        <p>Ko Samet (also Koh Samet) is about 220 kilometers south of Bangkok, and it's the closest tropical island to the capital. On a good traffic day, you can get there in about three hours if you're driving. Much of the island falls within a protected area, which for visitors means clean waters and nature, underdeveloped beaches, and a tight control on noise and pollution.

            There are 16 beaches on Ko Samet, only one of which is private. The other 15 are free to access and open to the public.
            
            The swimming is excellent no matter where on the island you are, but some beaches are all about relaxing on the sand while others offer plenty of water sports opportunities or great dining.

            Some of the beaches, including Laem Yai and Ao Lukyon, are tiny â€“ quiet stretches of perfect golden sand in front of the island's resorts or just off Samet Village.

            Others, like Ao Phrao and Ao Pakarang, are famous for the beautiful resorts lining up the coast and the mix of soft sand and rocky areas with plenty of shade.

            Koh Samet's largest beach is the one-kilometer-long Haad Sai Kaew or Diamond Beach. The most popular destination on the island, this is the place to be for action: Jet Skis, live music on the sand, and plenty of boats.
